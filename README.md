# VinVentory
VinVentory is a used car management system. The VinVentory app is aimed at small used car businesses to hold information about their sales and cars in stock. Using the Google Sheets API as a database, VinVentory provides the ability for multiple sites to have an easy way to see what cars are in stock on other sites.

### Ascii Art
To make the home screen more appealing, I wanted to incorporate the use of ascii art with the business details on the home screen.
I found an ascii art image of a car that I though fit the theme of the app from [ascii.co.uk/art/car](https://ascii.co.uk/art/car)
